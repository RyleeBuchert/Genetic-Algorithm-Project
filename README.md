# Genetic-Algorithm-Project
Project for CS-4623 (Evolution Computation), solving the P-median problem using a genetic algorithm and simulated annealing.

Implemented three search algorithms:
  - Genetic Algorithm -- Includes Roulette, Tournament, & Rank Selection and Single-Point, Double-Point, and Uniform Crossover Operators
  - Simulated Annealing
  - Foolish Hill-Climbing

The PDF report is included in this repo 'Genetic Algorithm Report'
