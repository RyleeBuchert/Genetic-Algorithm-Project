# Genetic-Algorithm-Project
Project for Evolution Computation (CS-4623), solving the P-median problem using a genetic algorithm and simulated annealing.

Implemented three search algorithms:
  - Genetic Algorithm -- Includes Roulette, Tournament, & Rank Selection and Single-Point, Double-Point, & Uniform Crossover Operators
  - Simulated Annealing
  - Foolish Hill-Climbing

The search algorithms were tested on 4 datasets of varying sizes: One 'small', one 'medium', and two 'large' datasets

The PDF report is included in this repo 'Genetic Algorithm Report'
